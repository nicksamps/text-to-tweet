# text-to-tweet
A simple service to turn a text into a tweet. My use case for this is for me to be able to tweet via my Somewear satellite messenger device. The Somewear can text US/CA phone numbers via satellite so all I need to do is turn a text into a tweet. [Twitter's text to tweet service](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-sms) won't work for this as it needs to be tied to my phone number, which won't work in this case as the texts will be coming from Somewear's phone numbers.
